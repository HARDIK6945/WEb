    <p>Hi, I'm Hardik Raikchura, a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Sipna College of Engineering and Technology, Amravati. My journey in technology began in 2022 with C programming, which laid the foundation for my problem-solving and logical thinking skills. I then delved into assembly language to understand the fundamentals of low-level programming. Building on this knowledge, I progressed to C++, enhancing my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts.</p>

    <p>Driven by a passion for innovation, I explored web development and gained proficiency in the MERN stack, developing projects utilizing ReactJS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs. Additionally, I honed my skills in creating responsive and engaging web interfaces using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. My journey then expanded into Python, where I developed impactful tools, including a Flask-based web application for removing EXIF metadata to ensure data privacy, an AI-driven Twitter post generator using Hugging Face’s API, and a content safety analyzer to identify harmful text. These projects allowed me to merge my programming expertise with real-world applications.</p>

    <p>One of my notable achievements includes being a finalist in Rackathon 2024, a national-level hackathon, where my team and I developed a cybersecurity tool with functionalities such as a metadata scrubber, social media post analyzer, password generator, and a cybersecurity blog reader. Currently, I am working on my final-year project, which focuses on object detection for railway safety systems. This project addresses critical use cases such as monitoring overcrowding, detecting falls on tracks, and identifying unattended luggage to enhance public safety through AI-powered solutions.</p>

    <p>In addition to my work in web development and Python, I have a strong command of Java, particularly in data structures and algorithms, which I continue to refine through regular practice on platforms like  <a style="color: red;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hardik-raichura-38039422a/?lipi=urn:li:page:d_flagship3_feed;LcTlTft/RPSuNHSTjYJsfg==">LeetCode</a> and <a style="color: red;" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/21be02t7v/">GFG</a> I am also proficient in database management systems, including SQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. To further expand my technical expertise and career prospects, I am actively exploring DevOps tools and practices.</p>

    <p>Passionate about solving real-world problems through technology, I continually strive to improve my skills and make meaningful contributions to the field. You can explore my projects and journey further on my <a style="color: red;"  href="https://github.com/HARDIK6945">Github</a> and <a style="color: red;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hardik-raichura-38039422a/?lipi=urn:li:page:d_flagship3_feed;LcTlTft/RPSuNHSTjYJsfg==">LinkedIn</a> profiles.
